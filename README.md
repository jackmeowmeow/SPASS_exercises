# SPASS_exercises
In this repository I'll put some easy SPASS exercises.
These problems are taken from Algebra or Classical Logic and they are implemented in .dfg files that runs with SPASS solver.
You can find SPASS here: https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/automation-of-logic/software/spass-workbench


You will find the text of the exercises inside the .dfg files :)
